# QR Pop üí•

QR Pop is an extremely simple iOS & MacOS Safari extension built to display a QR code for the website in focus. The Safari Extension is inspired by the quick QR Code feature in Google Chrome, and built using [qrcodejs](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs). QR Pop extends the Share Sheet/Share Menu on iOS and macOS to allow users to generate QR codes from most apps that share URLs as well.

## Privacy üïµÔ∏è

Safari extensions require user permission to access website data, and for good reason. The QR pop app reads the URL of every website a user visits, so that it can generate QR codes when called on.

The code is posted here in the interest of total transparency. All QR code processing happens on-device, so information like those URLs never leave the extension. There are also no trackers, loggers, etc. in the app.

## How it Works ‚öôÔ∏è

In Safari, QR Pop simply requests the URL from the page via JavaScript and then generates a QR code of that URL using [qrcodejs](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs).

In the Share Sheet/Share Menu, QR Pop accepts a URL (either in Swift's URL format or as a String) and generates a QR code using CoreImage. The app itself also allows for QR code generation using CoreImage. In the app, the user can customize the QR code by selecting a foreground and background.
