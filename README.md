QR Pop is a clean, convenient, and privacy-first QR code generator for macOS and iOS. 

It is built primarily using **Swift UI** and utilizes a variety of system extensions to allow for the creation of QR codes in Safari, the Share Sheet, and the app itself.

QR Pop can generate codes for URLs, Wi-Fi Networks, Calendar Events, Contacts, Locations, and more. Codes can be exported as images or saved to CoreData/iCloud.

## Privacy üïµÔ∏è
QR Pop contains no logging or analytics packages and, in fact, does not perform any network requests at all. That being said, QR Pop does utilize CloudKit alongside CoreData. iCloud usage is optional and is subject to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/).

Likewise, the QR Pop Safari Extension does not contain a content script and does not read the content of any webpages. Like the main application, the QR Pop Safari Extension does not interface with any external servers and instead creates all codes on-device.

## Building this project üõ†Ô∏è
1. Clone the Repo
2. Update the signing `Team` for each target.
3. Build

QR Pop uses the Swift Package Manager, so building is fairly straight forward.
